To create your little Wiki server you need to know your ip adress.

In the console, type ifconfig eth0 and record the inet adr.

For instance:

jp@jp-laptop:~$ ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:c0:9e:1c:77:31  
          inet adr:191.149.1.58   ...

So my inet adress is: 191.149.1.58

If ciwiki runs in default mode, the port is 8000 
(use "ciwiki --port xxxx" to change it) and the adress the users will 
have to enter in their browser is 191.149.1.58:8000
