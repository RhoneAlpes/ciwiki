Ciwiki has is own favicon stored inside the code but it's possible to override it.
At the startup, it will load the favicon file named .favicon.ico located in the folder .ciwiki
(this folder is hidden, check Show hidden files in your files browser).

The favicon file must have the name .favicon.ico and must be hidden (dot before the file name).
The file must be in the folder .ciwiki and the file can't exceed 1024 bits.

If .favicon.ico doesn't exist or cannot be read or is larger than 1024 bytes, the default favicon is used.

The favicon is loaded during the startup of ciwiki. If you change the .favicon.ico file, you will have to stop 
and restart ciwiki.

Firefox need to be stopped and restarted to load the new favicon (I didn't test the other web browser).

You can create your favicon online with http://www.favicon.cc/ , it's very easy and 
your favicon can be animated. Dont forget, ciwiki will not load favicon larger than 1024 bytes.

Note: Example of favicon.ico is available in /docs; copy it in /.ciwiki and rename it .favicon.ico
