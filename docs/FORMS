There is a possibility to create a simple form with one entry, 
usefull to make a todo list for example.

There are 4 tags:
{{entry}}
{{data}}
{{delete}}
{{save}}

{{entry}} create a simple entry field and a button "add".

{{data}} mark the place where the entries are written (just after
 the tag). This tag must be terminated with a new line.
Note: A checkbox is automatically added with each entry.
 
{{save}} saves the status of the checkbox (checked).
{{delete}} removes the entries checked.


Extra parameters for entry:

tiny small medium large huge define the lenght of the entry.
date inserts a date in the entry.
data asks to write the entries after the tag {entry...} , {{data}} is not 
required in this case. Example: {{entry large date data}}

save and delete can be combined: {{save delete}}.

Other examples of Todo list:
Simple:

{{entry large data}}
{{save delete}}

With labels:

{{entry}}
List of things to do:

{{data}}

Actions:
{{delete save}}
