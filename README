CiWiki README
==============

CiWiki is a small and simple WikiWikiWeb implementation written in
C. It's intended for personal use for notes, Todo lists, etc. It includes
its' own webserver and hopefully its as simple as just compiling, running
and pointing your browser at it. 

Installation
============

To build do the usual:
./configure
make
sudo make install

Then type: ciwiki -a -s

On startup it'll tell you the address to point your browser at. 
You should then be ready to go. 

To notify new users via email of their validation code, login and password,
you need ssmpt and the script notifynewuser.sh .
notifynewuser.sh is located in the folder /usr/local/libexec
(sudo make install should copy this script on the right place).
If you install this script in another place, you will have to edit 
the line #89 in ciwiki-2.x.x/src/ci.h
#define SCRIPTMAIL "/usr/local/libexec/notifynewuser.sh>/dev/null 2>&1 &" 
#define SCRIPTMAIL "/new place/notifynewuser.sh>/dev/null 2>&1 &" 

If you do not use the default port 8000, you will have to edit notifynewuser.sh 
line #25 to provide the actual port #.
