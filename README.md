# ciwiki
This is the original lightweight wiki for personal notes and collaborative wiki.
It's a fork of didiwiki. I started on 2010, adding more functionalities such as:

- Text and highlight colors
- Image width height, border size, position
- Video flash (youtube,dailymotion...) embedded
- Save-retreive previous pages
- Login procedure. Edit, delete and page view permission
- Nested expand and collapse boxes, Table of Content (TOC)
- Simple entry form (for ToDo list)
- Diff between current and previous page
- Uploading and downloading files
- Page templates
 
Ciwiki is running on Linux and is tested on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) too.
It doesn't require a lot of memory. pmap returns:
- Less than 1.8 Mbyte on Raspbian (1.37M are for libc-2.13 'ARM')
- Less than 4.5 Nbyte on Ubuntu 12.04 (3.99M are for libc-2.19 '64bits')
